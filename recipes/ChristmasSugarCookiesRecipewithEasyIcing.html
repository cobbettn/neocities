              Make sure you have allotted enough time (and enough counter
              space!) to make these cookies. The cookie dough needs to chill,
              the cookies need to cool completely, and the icing needs 24 hours
              to completely set. If enjoying right away and hardened icing isn’t
              a concern, you’ll only need about 3–4 hours to make these.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Make the cookie dough: Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt
              together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a
              paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high
              speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the
              egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using), and beat on high
              speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up
              the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low
              until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too
              soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a
              piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured
              silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the
              dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough
              seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long
              as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a
              piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the
              second rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or
              aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1–2 hours and up to 2
              days.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2–3 large baking
              sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully
              remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking
              to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a
              cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining
              dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with second
              piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but
              you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Arrange cookies on baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Bake for
              11–12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your
              oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake
              time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes,
              then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
              No need to cover the cookies as they cool.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Make the icing: Using a fork, stir the confectioners’ sugar,
              vanilla, corn syrup, and 4.5 Tablespoons (67ml) of water together
              in a medium bowl. It will be very thick and almost impossible to
              stir. Switch to a whisk and whisk in 1/2 Tablespoon (8ml) more of
              water. If you lift the whisk and let the icing drizzle back into
              the bowl, the ribbon of icing will hold shape for a few seconds
              before melting back into the icing. That is when you know it’s the
              right consistency and is ready to use. If it’s too thick
              (sometimes it is), whisk in another 1/2 Tablespoon (8ml) of water
              or a little more until you reach the proper consistency.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              If you’re tinting the icing another color, stir in the food
              coloring. You can pour some icing into different bowls if using
              multiple colors. When tinting icing, use only 1–2 drops at first,
              stir it in, then add more as needed to reach your desired color.
              Remember, color darkens as icing dries.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Decorate the cookies: You can dip the cookies into the icing or
              use squeeze bottles or piping bags (reusable or disposable) fitted
              with piping tips (I usually use Wilton Piping Tip #4). Decorate
              your cookies as desired. If using the squeeze bottles or piping
              tips, I usually outline cookies with icing first, then fill in the
              middle. If adding sprinkles on top of the icing, add them right
              after applying icing on your cookie.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Let icing dry/set: Feel free to enjoy cookies before icing
              completely dries. Icing dries in 24 hours. No need to cover the
              decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s
              helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you
              can place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help
              slightly speed up the icing setting. Once the icing has dried,
              these cookies are great for gifting or for sending.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
              Cover and store decorated cookies for up to 5 days at room
              temperature or up to 10 days in the refrigerator.

          <div itemprop="comment" class="notes text">
            <p>
              Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze
              well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before
              layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly
              container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room
              temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3
              months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 4,
              divide in half, flatten both halves into a disc as we do with pie
              crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the
              discs in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for
              about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 5, then chill
              rolled-out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes–1 hour before
              cutting into shapes and baking.

              Room Temperature Butter: Room temperature butter is essential. If
              the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room
              temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature
              egg is preferred so it’s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie
              dough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flavors: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon
              almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter
              flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using
              1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or
              peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground
              cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon
              lemon zest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Corn Syrup: Corn syrup gives the icing sticking power and creates
              a beautiful sheen on the dried icing. I don’t recommend skipping
              it, but you can if absolutely needed.
